          <p>Enthusiastic and detail-oriented entry-level web developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, recently completing Tech Elevator's Java Bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience with the Java, Vue3, and PostgreSQL stack. I have successfully completed multiple projects, including leading teams in developing a store locator web application and an inventory management system, demonstrating my leadership and mentoring abilities.<br><br>
          With a background in business management, I bring excellent communication, conflict resolution, and customer retention skills to the table, ensuring a collaborative and productive team environment. My journey in education includes studying general studies at Marion Technical College before transferring to Ohio State University for Architecture, where I developed a keen eye for detail and creative problem-solving.<br><br>
          In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about 3D sketching and modeling, which complements my CAD experience. I thrive in team settings and am eager to contribute to innovative projects while continuing to grow as a developer.</p>
